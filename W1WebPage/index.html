        <h1>Vincenzo Coppola</h1>
        <p style="width: 400px">My name is <u>Vincenzo Coppola</u> but people call me <b>Vinny</b> for short. I am 22 years old and my birthday is November 10th, 2001. Some of my hobbies include playing video games, hanging out with friends and mainly working. I am currently in the Cybersecurity path at <i>NEIT</i> and trying to get into a career doing what I actually enjoy doing. I put off going to college after high school since I had a lot gooing on in my life and I ended up moving to Alaska for a year and a half. I moved back to Rhode Island and decided I needed to start my education again so here I am now.</p>
